## Part 1: Project Architecture

### Component Architecture
Our project follows a strict component architecture based on Atomic Design principles. This architecture emphasizes:
- Pure, stateless components for better maintainability
- Clear separation of concerns
- Predictable component behavior
- Easy testing and debugging

For detailed information about our component architecture and guidelines, please refer to the [Component Architecture Guide](./src/components/README.md).

By following these instructions, you can efficiently set up and run the project in both production and development environments. Feel free to explore the scripts for more details on what each command does.
